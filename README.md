Abstract:
In our opinion, the best neighborhood is determined based on how many outside facilities - playgrounds, and playing fields -  and the pool capacity in gallons a neighborhood has. These facilities allow for people to enjoy the outside, which has been proven very important during the current COVID-19 pandemic. From these metrics, we determined that the best neighborhood was Highland Park.
