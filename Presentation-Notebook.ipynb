    "* Our data sets had many top neighborhoods in common, but none the exact same as the \"absolute top best.\" so we had to go down the lists a bit to compare. We did several comparisons to pick:\n",
    "    * Carrick was third in playing fields, fourth in playgrounds, and eighth in pools.\n",
    "    * Beechview was second in playgrounds and fifth in playing fields, but had a NaN value for pools. \n",
    "    * Brighton Heights was first in playing fields, tenth in pools, and fifth in playgrounds. \n",
    "    * Highland Park was first in pools, third in playgrounds, and fourth in playing fields.\n",
    "    \n",
    "* These are the comparisons that led us to chose Highland Park as the \"Best Neighborhood in Pittsburgh.\" With a 560242 gallon pool capacity, 4 playgrounds, and 4 playing fields, while it wasn't the highest in every category, none of the other neighborhoods could come close to it. "

    "#### Erin's Conclusion:\n",
    "* I was kind of shocked by the results, just because I had never heard the name \"Highland Park\" before. My family is from Pittsburgh, but I haven't lived there since I've been 10, so I'm not very familiar with the different neighborhoods. So, I decided to look it up. [On the Pittsburgh Parks website](https://pittsburghparks.org/explore-your-parks/regional-parks/highland-park/) I found that it has \"...a popular bike track, swimming pool, sand volleyball courts, and the Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium.\" I found that neat, since it fits with our metric. I feel that this, along with our data, supports the idea of Highland Park being the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh. "

    "#### Michael's Conclusion:\n",
    "* I am not very familiar with the neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, but the results of our study were not all that unpredictable. For example, the city that was the best neighborhood by our metric and standard of bestness of a neighborhood in Pittsburgh was Highland Park and it had a total area of 1.163 mi². On the other hand, the neighborhood, Stanton Heights that ranked poorly by our metric and standard of bestness had 470 acres (which is less than the area of Highland Park). So, it makes sense that Highland Park ranked higher because it has more room for pools, playgrounds, and playing fields. This is further evidence that our conclusion that Highland Park is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh is reliable."

    "* Although I am from Pittsburgh, I was very shocked to see that Highland Park was rated as the best neighborhood. I have lived here my whole life, but I have never even heard of the neighborhood Highland Park. However, based on the metrics we chose and data we collected, I trust that Highland Park is considered the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh."
